# Debugging Fundamentals

The goal of this module is to provide an overview of debugging features in .NET and Visual Studio. The practical task is to use debugging to solve existing problems with the code. 

### Questions for the self-check:

1. What is break mode? What are the options to step through code?

2. How to ignore some exceptions during debugging?
